## 🚀 About Me

I’m a curious and dedicated developer in training.  
Currently working as a software development intern where I learn through real-world backend and frontend tasks.

My goal is to grow into a **full-stack developer**, combining logic, structure, and clean code — slowly but consistently.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning and Practicing

- 📌 **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue.js  
- 📌 **Backend**: Node.js, PHP, Laravel, and now learning Go  
- 📌 **RESTful APIs** and `fetch` for data consumption  
- 📌 **Databases**: MySQL and PostgreSQL  
- 📌 **Version Control** with Git  
- 📌 **Programming Logic** and how to think like a developer
